**PROJECT OVERVIEW**

This project explores the Tesco Grocery 1.0 Dataset (2015) with a focus on uncovering key insights into consumer purchasing behavior. To deepen the analysis, an education dataset representing London boroughs was also studied to identify how educational levels may relate to shopping trends.

The goal is to understand patterns in the data and communicate findings clearly through:
Jupyter Notebook-based analysis
A presentation deck
An infographic summarizing key insights

This work includes clear assumptions for both datasets and serves as a learning project in data analysis, storytelling, and visualization.



**REPOSITORY STRUCTURE**

1. tesco_analysis.ipynb: Main notebook with data cleaning, exploration, and insights
2. presentation.pptx: Presentation used to explain findings to an audience
3. infographic.pdf: Visual summary using data insights and conclusions
4. README.md: Project overview (this file)
5. Datasets used: 
- **Tesco Grocery 1.0 Dataset (2015)**: https://figshare.com/collections/Tesco_Grocery_1_0/4769354
- **Highest level of qualification by economic activity status** 
  This dataset was originally available from the Office for National Statistics [Online], 2023. (Available from: https://www.ons.gov.uk/datasets/RM048/editions/2021/versions/3.)
  But it is no longer hosted online.  
  A local copy (`education.csv`) is included in this repository for educational purposes only.


**PROJECT FINDINGS**

Study and explore the Tesco dataset for identifying borough wise trends in deographcis, product purchases and consumer behaviour. 
Use education-level data from London boroughs to assess general trends in how education might relate to purchasing patterns.
Share findings through data visualizations, a presentation, and an infographic.
Make assumptions transparent for both datasets and clearly communicate limitations.


**TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES**
Python: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, geopandas, numpy, plotly
Jupyter Notebook: for data analysis and visualisation
PowerPoint/Keynote: for insights presentation
Design Tool (e.g. Canva): for infographic creation


**ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS**
Data is representative of the purchases and consumption of general population.
Food purchases reflects household consumption and dietary preferences.
Use of aggregated data only.
Potential geographic bias.
2021 data used as a proxy for 2015, assuming minimal change in education levels.
Includes all residents except homeschooled individuals.


**OUTPUTS**
In-depth data exploration notebook
Insightful visualizations
Slide deck explaining the findings
Infographic summarizing key takeaways
